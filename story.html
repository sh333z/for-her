<div class="story-container">
    <p class="story-line">This is not a love this is our story .</p>

    <p class="story-line">We didn’t meet like people in movies.<br>
    No flowers. No smiles.<br>
    We met by fighting online.</p>

    <p class="story-line">Two strangers. Two egos.<br>
    Anger in words… but destiny was quietly smiling.</p>

    <p class="story-line">After the fight, something strange happened.<br>
    We didn’t block each other.<br>
    We talked.</p>

    <p class="story-line">Days turned into late-night texts, and one night…<br>
    she sang a song for me.</p>

    <p class="story-line">Her voice wasn’t just music.<br>
    It felt like comfort.<br>
    That was the moment my heart betrayed me—<br>
    I got a crush on her without permission.</p>

    <p class="story-line">I waited.<br>
    Seven long months.</p>

    <p class="story-line">Every day I liked her more, feared losing her more.<br>
    And one day, I finally said it…<br>
    “I love you.”</p>

    <p class="story-line">She didn’t answer immediately.<br>
    But when she did…<br>
    she said yes.</p>

    <p class="story-line">That “yes” changed my life.</p>

    <p class="story-line">The first time I met her in real life,<br>
    I travelled 200 kilometers at night,<br>
    with a heart racing faster than the bus.</p>

    <p class="story-line">I entered her house quietly…<br>
    and then I saw her.</p>

    <p class="story-line">Her eyes.<br>
    Her hair.<br>
    Her smell.<br>
    Everything felt unreal—like she stepped out of my prayers.</p>

    <p class="story-line">She came closer…<br>
    and kissed me on my lips.</p>

    <p class="story-line">That was our first touch.<br>
    My world stopped breathing for a second.</p>

    <p class="story-line">We started meeting once a month,<br>
    counting days like children waiting for festivals.</p>

    <p class="story-line">One night at 2 o’clock,<br>
    she came with me on my bike.</p>

    <p class="story-line">I kissed her neck gently—<br>
    not out of desire,<br>
    but out of love and pride.</p>

    <p class="story-line">Then life tested us.</p>

    <p class="story-line">no messages.<br>
    No calls.<br>
    Only memories.</p>

    <p class="story-line">Then one day…<br>
    a notification.<br>
    Her name.</p>

    <p class="story-line">Today, it’s been four years.</p>

    <p class="story-line highlight">We didn’t have a perfect story—<br>
    we had a real one.</p>
